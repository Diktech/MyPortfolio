## DATA ANALYTICS PROJECTS 
### Cyclistic Case study
The data analysis workflow is a follows: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze and Share (combined in this case), and Act.

Introduction
Business Task
In this case study Iworked as a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a  bike-share company in Chicago. The Marketing director believes that if the company will record more success, the casual memebers must be converted to annual memebers. Therefore, my job is to draw insight on how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.

The stakeholder is Lily Moreno, the director of marketing and my manager. The other stakeholders for this project are the executive team.

Through this data analysis I want to find out how do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. After analysis, the goal is to make recommendations to the stakeholders.

#### Preparing the data
Data sources Used
Previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data made available by Motivate International Inc. Link here: (https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)

Data integrity: Can not be verified since I am not familiar with the company

Data Errors and Issues: Data has issues with duplicate data, Null values, and invalid data.

Tools Choosing to work with R due to it’s flexibility, and the fact that we have a large dataset.

Data should help me answer the question of “how do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?” because I have access to a year’s worth of data for both casual and member riders. Data has over 4 million records which is a lot.


Summary and Recommendations
Learned that a docked bicycle type is around 2 times as popular compared to casual and electric bikes. This applies to both casual and member bicycle users.

Learned that Saturday and Sunday are the most popular riding days for casual riders.

November through February have the least number of casual riders, perhaps due to cold winter months.

May, July, and August have a particularly high number of Casual riders.

The most popular stations for Casual riders in descending order are Streeter Dr & Grand Ave, Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St, Millennium Park, Theater on the Lake, Michigan Ave & Oak St.

Conclusion: Based on the data analyzed I would recommend we focus our marketing effors for Casual Riders with these parameters 1, Increase marketing for docket bicycles 2. Heavier marketing from May through August 3. Focus marketing on weekends 4. Invest in marketing at the top 5 stations as noted above. Top 10 station marketing would cover even more ground.
